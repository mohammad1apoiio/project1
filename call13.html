 <h1>Review of Call of Duty Warzone</h1>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
 The presence of a variety of weapons, the ability to use keystrokes, the
 ability to customize weapons with different items and finally exciting
 gameplay, without interruption and with accurate gun play, made Modern
 Warfare a powerful effect for the experience of all fans of online shooter
 games .
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
 We've seen a lot of Battle Royale games to date, but first I have to say
 that the beta version of Call of Duty Warzone has been able to have a
 faster rhythm than other Battle Royales. Huge maps with all the details
 and suitable for the type of game of different people from Snape to
 players with more aggressive game style and the presence of 150 players
 simultaneously in groups of three or single player mode, has made us a
 fast and exciting Battle Royale mode. . The general rule, like all other
 Battle Royales, is clear: Find good items quickly and stay alive to the
 end! Fortunately, although we did not see a solo mode at the time of
 release, players can now enter the Battlerovalzon competition as single
 players.
 </p>

<br>

<h4>
  Call of Duty Warzone game has two modes of Battle Royale and Planer for
  players experience
 </h4>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Battalion mode as well as looting, the ability to navigate weapons, the
  enemy, or places to communicate better when using the group, a feature
  known for downloading in Apex Legends, is another integral part of online
  gaming. Has been. Regardless of the known features, one of Varzon's
  creations can return to life from purgatory. Thus, especially in Solo
  mode, for the first time in a Battle Royale game, there is a chance to
  return to the race after death. After being killed, he enters a fight with
  a tone similar to the modern warfare game mode, which is named here as
  Gulag.Your only duty in this purgatory after death is to kill the opponent
  and get another chance to win the final battle of Varzon. Returning to the
  battlefield happens quickly, but this time it is no longer a weapon of the
  past and you have to find new weapons again while the other enemies are
  armed to the teeth.

  always respected by our comrades and feared by the enemies. He studied
  with General Shepherd and was one of his best forces with his
  extraordinary shooting skills and high resistance under pressure. The
  bitter point of the story is that he was killed by his trainer, General
  Shepherd, and his death brought tears to the eyes of every gamer who knew
